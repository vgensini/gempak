# SFL604

SFL604 lists data from a GEMPAK surface file in a fixed format.

### Input Parameters
 
    SFFILE    Surface data file
    AREA      Data area
    DATTIM    Date/time
    OUTPUT    Output device/filename
    SKPMIS    Skip missing data flag
    IDNTYP    STNM or STID
    SFPARM    Surface parameter list
 
 

### Program Description
 
SFL604 lists data from a surface file in a format designed to
display airways data.

Data will be listed for the stations and times requested in
AREA and DATTIM.  If SKPMIS is YES, stations that are within
the area requested, but have not reported data, will not
be listed.  If SKPMIS is set to NO, then only the date and
station identifier will be listed for nonreporting stations.

Stations may be identified in the output listing by character
or numeric identifier.  This is accomplished by setting IDNTYP
to STID or STNM.

This program will list predefined parameters only.  However,
stations may be selected using conditions in SFPARM.  For
example, if `SFPARM = WTHR=S+`, then only those stations
reporting heavy snow will be listed.  The conditions specified
in SFPARM can be for any computable parameter, not just
those to be listed.

 
### Examples
 
1.	List the data for all stations in Pennsylvania at
the most recent time.

        SFFILE	 =  $GEMPAK/data/hrcbob.sfc
        AREA	 =  @pa
        DATTIM	 =  last
        OUTPUT	 =  t
        SKPMIS	 =  yes
        IDNTYP	 =  stid
        SFPARM	 =

2.	List the data for all times at PHL.
    
        SFFILE	 =  $GEMPAK/data/hrcbob.sfc
        AREA	 =  @phl
        DATTIM	 =  all
        OUTPUT	 =  t
        SKPMIS	 =  yes
        IDNTYP	 =  stid
        SFPARM	 =

3.	List all stations in Pennsylvania, including nonreporting
stations for the last time.

        SFFILE	 =  $GEMPAK/data/hrcbob.sfc
        AREA	 =  @pa
        DATTIM	 =  last
        OUTPUT	 =  t
        SKPMIS	 =  no
        IDNTYP	 =  STID
        SFPARM	 =

4.	List all stations in Pennsylvania where there are reported
thunderstorms.
    
        SFFILE	 =  $GEMPAK/data/hrcbob.sfc
        AREA	 =  @pa
        DATTIM	 =  LAST
        OUTPUT	 =  t
        SKPMIS	 =  yes
        IDNTYP	 =  STID
        SFPARM	 =  wthr=t
